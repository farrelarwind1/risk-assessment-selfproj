Credit risk assessment is an important step in determining whether a credit application should be approved or rejected. Data from credit applicants is analyzed using predictive analytics techniques to estimate the likelihood of default. 

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the risk of granting credit by distinguishing high-risk from low-risk applicants. The predictive model developed aims to identify patterns related to the risk of credit applicants.
